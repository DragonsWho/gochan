Welcome to gochan! The front page hasn't been created yet, so you will need to log in and build it. You can do so <a href="/manage?action=rebuildall">here</a>. The default username is "admin", and the default password is "password". For security reasons, you should probably change that befor you go public.<br />
Next, you should create a board, which you can do <a href="/manage?action=manageboards">here</a>.<br />
Thank you for using gochan.
